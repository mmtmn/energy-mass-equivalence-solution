# Energy Mass Equivalence Solution

There are several physical forces that can affect the relationship between mass and energy, which the equation E=mc^2 does not take into consideration. Some examples of these forces include:

1. Gravity: Gravity is a force that attracts two masses towards each other. It is described by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which takes into account the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass or energy.

2. Electromagnetic forces: Electromagnetic forces are the forces that arise from the interaction of charged particles. These forces include the forces between charged particles and the forces that hold atoms together.

3. Strong nuclear force: The strong nuclear force is the force that holds the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom together. It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and gravity.

4. Weak nuclear force: The weak nuclear force is the force that is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay, such as beta decay. It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force, and gravity.

The equation E=mc^2 does not take into account the effects of these forces, as it is a fundamental principle of physics that describes the relationship between mass and energy in a general sense. It is a widely accepted and well-established scientific theory, but it is not a complete description of the behavior of mass and energy in all circumstances.



**The equation E_total = E + E_g + E_e + E_b + E_k represents the total energy of an object, which is the sum of its kinetic energy (E), gravitational potential energy (E_g), electric potential energy (E_e), binding energy (E_b), and kinetic energy (E_k).** 

We than bruteforce it, it still requires some logic cleaning so its more efficient and only prints our mathematically valid iterations of the equations.
